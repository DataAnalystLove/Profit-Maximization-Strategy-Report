### Data Source

The primary dataset used for this project is the 'sales _data.excel' file. The dataset for this project encompasses essential columns such as salesperson, product, region, customer, date, item price, number of items, and revenue. These data points serve as the foundation for analyzing sales performance and formulating strategies to enhance profitability. 

### Tools

- MS Excel: Utilizing the power of Microsoft Excel, I used MS Excel for data cleaning, in-depth data analysis, and the creation of visually engaging reports and interactive dashboard visualization.

### Data Cleaning
In this report, I will outline the data cleaning process undertaken to prepare the dataset for analysis. The dataset, which contains sales information from various regions, required several steps to ensure accuracy and consistency. Below are the key actions taken to clean and organize the data effectively. 

- Loaded the dataset into ms excel
- Removed duplicates (none found): select data > click data tab > click  remove duplicates icon.
- used the PROPER function in the Salesperson column to convert text to proper case, correcting mixed capitalization.
- Applied VALUE(CLEAN) function in the item price column to eliminate non-printable characters and convert text values to numbers.
- The revenue column automatically updates by formatting it to calculate item price multiplied by the number of items  = H2 * I2 
- Inserted two additional columns to extract Year and Month values from the Date column
- utilized the YEAR function to extract the year from the Date column; =YEAR(K2 : K911)
- Employed the MONTH function to extract the month from the Date column;  =YEAR(L2 : L911)

### Business Questions  
As I dug deeper uncovering the profit maximization strategies to introduce, my analysis begins to focus on the sales team and how to increase the revenue margin. Hence, these business questions popped up and  serve as my direction. They are as follows;

1. How does revenue vary across different regions, which regions are underperforming, why and how can we improve?
2. What product categories are driving the highest & lowest sales, and how can we capitalize on them further?
3. Which salesperson contributes the highest sales, are they any pattern in their performance? How can the less performing salespersons tailor their approcah to meet the unique needs of different customer segemts and regions to boost sales?
4. Can we identify key customers who generate the most revenue and tailor strategies to retain and grow their business?
5. Is there a seasonal trend in sales perfoemance, how can we adjust strategies to maximize profits during peak periods?
