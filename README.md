## Project Overview

I was intrested in knowing  about looking This data analysis project aims to uncover insights on boosting profits through strategic decision- making based on sales performance across different dimensions. By examimng these key factors, I seek to gain valuable insights to drive profitability and optimize business strategies. 

### Data Source

The primary dataset used for this project is the 'sales _data.excel' file. The dataset for this project encompasses essential columns such as salesperson, product, region, customer, date, item price, number of items, and revenue. These data points serve as the foundation for analyzing sales performance and formulating strategies to enhance profitability. 

### Tools

- MS Excel: Utilizing the power of Microsoft Excel, I used MS Excel for data cleaning, in-depth data analysis, and the creation of visually engaging reports and interactive dashboard visualization.

### Data Cleaning

In the data cleaning/preparation phase, I perfromed the following tasks;
 1. Loading and inspection into MS Excel
2.  Remove duplicates (none found): select data > click data tab > click  remove duplicates icon.
3.  In salesperson column, I used =PROPER function to convert text to proper case
4.  Item_price, I used =VALUE(CLEAN) function to remove non-printable character and convert text values to numbers.
5.  Revenue column, automatically updated because it was formatted to be this; item price * no.items = G2 * H2 
6.  I inserted two extra columns to extract year and month values from date column 
7.  To extract year using the year function; =YEAR(F2 : F911)
8.  To extract month using the month function; =YEAR(F2 : F911)

### Business Questions  
As I dug deeper uncovering the profit maximization strategies to introduce, my analysis begins to focus on the sales team and how to increase the revenue margin. Hence, these business questions popped up and  serve as my direction. They are as follows;

1. How does revenue vary across different regions, which regions are underperforming, why and how can we improve?
2. What product categories are driving the highest & lowest sales, and how can we capitalize on them further?
3. Which salesperson contributes the highest sales, are they any pattern in their performance? How can the less performing salespersons tailor their approcah to meet the unique needs of different customer segemts and regions to boost sales?
4. Can we identify key customers who generate the most revenue and tailor strategies to retain and grow their business?
5. Is there a seasonal trend in sales perfoemance, how can we adjust strategies to maximize profits during peak periods?
